This library provides components to enable gesture-based screen manipulation such as pinch and pan, commonly seen in native apps on iOS and Android, on the web.

Note: This library is in early development. Don't stick to keeping the current API. Rather, pursue the best API you can think of, and we'll iterate on it together.
