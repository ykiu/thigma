This library provides components to enable gesture-based screen manipulation such as pinch and pan, commonly seen in native apps on iOS and Android, on the web.

Note: This library is in early development. Don't stick to keeping the current API. Rather, pursue the best API you can think of, and we'll iterate on it together.

## Document Structure

You can refer to the following documents as needed.

- [Architecture](./design/00_architecture.md)

## Workflow

When making changes to the codebase, follow this workflow:

1. Ask for clarification if the change is not clearly defined.
2. Plan your change.
3. Ask for feedback on your plan.
4. Review the plan with the "typescript-review" skill and evaluate the feedback.
5. Update documents as needed.
6. Implement your change in a test-driven manner.
7. Run code quality checks
   `npm run tsc && npm run format && npm run lint && npm run test`.
8. Review your implementation with the "typescript-review" skill and evaluate the feedback.
9. Iterate on your implementation based on feedback until finalized.

## Human Language
