# Architecture of the Web Pinch/Pan Library

## Conventions

All transformations in this library are expressed as a combination of transformX, transformY, and scale. The transform-origin for scale is set to the top-left corner of the target element. To make it appear as though scaling is centered on the pinch gesture's midpoint, the library computes appropriate transformX and transformY values based on the pinch origin (the actual scale transform is always applied relative to the top-left corner).

## Common Type Definitions

```typescript
type UnsubscribeFn = () => void;
type UnmountFn = () => void;
type Callback<T> = (value: T) => void;
```

**Reducer** is the core abstraction for state machines in this library. A Reducer is a pure function that takes the current state and an action, and returns the next state:

```typescript
type Reducer<TState, TStoreAction> = (state: TState, action: TStoreAction) => TState;
```

Some reducers also return an optional output event alongside the new state (e.g. Interpreter reducers that emit an `InterpreterEvent`):

```typescript
// Variant used by Interpreters
reduce(state, action) => { state: TState; event?: TOutputEvent }
```

**Model** is the top-level abstraction that bundles a reducer with a projection function. It encapsulates both the private state machine and the mapping to a public-facing state that consumers observe:

```typescript
interface Model<TPublicState, TTransformPrivateState, TStoreAction> {
  reduce: Reducer<TTransformPrivateState, TStoreAction>;
  publish(state: TTransformPrivateState): TPublicState;
}
```

**Motion** is the motion payload used internally by the Store. It represents the relative change from the previous state. For pan gestures, use `dScale: 1` and `originX/Y: 0`.

```typescript
type Motion = {
  dx: number;      // horizontal translation delta (px)
  dy: number;      // vertical translation delta (px)
  dScale: number;  // multiplicative scale factor (1.0 = no change, 1.1 = 10% zoom in)
  originX: number; // scale origin X, relative to the element's top-left corner (px)
  originY: number; // scale origin Y, relative to the element's top-left corner (px)
};
```

**InterpreterEvent** is the output of an Interpreter. It is a tagged union that covers gesture movement, the moment the user releases the gesture, and discrete tap gestures.

```typescript
type InterpreterEvent =
  | ({ type: 'motion'; itemId?: string; timestamp: number } & Motion)                                        // user is actively gesturing
  | { type: 'release'; itemId?: string }                                                                      // user lifted all fingers / released the mouse button
  | { type: 'toggle-zoom'; itemId?: string; originX: number; originY: number; timestamp: number };           // double-tap: zoom in if at normal scale, zoom out otherwise
```

The optional `itemId` field identifies which item within a multi-item container (e.g. a carousel) the gesture targets. It is absent for container-level gestures such as swiping the carousel strip itself.

The `timestamp` on motion events is taken from the originating DOM event (`e.timeStamp`) and is used by the Store to compute accurate time deltas for velocity tracking.

**State** is the output of the Store and represents the current transform applied to the target element. Velocity information is kept as internal Store state and is not exposed.

```typescript
type State = {
  transformX: number; // horizontal translation (px)
  transformY: number; // vertical translation (px)
  scale: number;      // scale factor (1.0 = original size)
};
```

## State Machine Design

All stateful logic in this library is implemented as pure reducer functions. This is a library-wide principle that applies to every module that maintains state.

### State Representation with Tagged Unions

Each stateful component models its internal state as a tagged union, where each variant represents a distinct and valid configuration. With tagged unions, impossible states become inexpressible — the type system enforces invariants with no runtime checks required. The set of valid state transitions also becomes self-documenting: a `touchmove` event received in a `no_touch` state cannot reach the code path that computes a pan motion, because that path pattern-matches on `single_touch`.

### Reducer Pattern

State transitions are implemented as pure reducers. Separating pure transition logic from side effects (event subscription, output event emission) yields two practical benefits:

1. **Testability**: A reducer can be tested as a plain function with no DOM or framework setup — pass a state and an action, assert on the returned state and optional output event.
2. **Traceability**: Every state change originates from a named action, making the flow of data easy to follow and debug.

Side effects are confined to a thin `dispatch()` wrapper that calls `reduce`, updates the stored state, and handles any output event returned by the reducer.

### Reference Equality Contract

To support the Store's pause/resume optimization, all Reducers must follow a **reference equality contract**: when an action causes no state change, return the same object reference rather than a new object with identical values. This allows the Store to detect a settled state with a simple `===` check.

## Module Composition

The library consists of four primary modules:

1. **Interpreter**: Responsible for detecting and processing gestures. Captures user input and identifies gestures such as pinch and pan.
2. **Model**: Contains the state transition logic (reducer) for transformations. Describes how the transform state evolves in response to gestures and animation ticks.
3. **Store**: A generic event loop that wires together Interpreters and a reducer. Drives the animation loop and notifies subscribers on each frame.
4. **Renderer**: Responsible for rendering the target element. Reads from the Store and applies transformations to the actual DOM element.

## Interpreter Module

The role of this module is to abstract user input events such as TouchEvent and MouseEvent, and interpret them as meaningful actions such as zoom or pan. The module provides a state machine that takes these events as input.

The Interpreter emits detected gesture information as **InterpreterEvent**. Motion events express transformations as relative changes from the previous state. A release event is emitted when the user lifts all fingers or releases the mouse button. Events are delivered to the outside world via a callback provided to the Interpreter.

Key interfaces and functions:

```typescript
type Interpreter = (element: Element) => MountedInterpreter;
type MountedInterpreter = {
  subscribe: (cb: Callback<InterpreterEvent>) => UnsubscribeFn;
  unmount: UnmountFn;
};

declare function touchInterpreter(): Interpreter;
declare function mouseDragInterpreter(): Interpreter;
declare function mouseWheelInterpreter(): Interpreter;
declare function doubleTapInterpreter(): Interpreter;
```

Implementation details:

- When called, an Interpreter begins listening to the target element's events via addEventListener. Listening stops when UnmountFn is called.
- **touchInterpreter**: A factory function for an interpreter that handles touch events. Tracks multiple touch points and identifies gestures such as pinch and pan.
- **mouseDragInterpreter**: A factory function for an interpreter that handles mouse drag events. Tracks mouse movement and identifies pan gestures.
- **mouseWheelInterpreter**: A factory function for an interpreter that handles mouse wheel events. Tracks wheel rotation and identifies zoom gestures.
- **doubleTapInterpreter**: A factory function for an interpreter that detects double-tap gestures. Handles the native `dblclick` event for mouse and manually tracks two consecutive single-finger touches within a time and distance threshold for touch. Emits `toggle-zoom`.

### State Representation

Each stateful interpreter models its internal state as a tagged union following the library-wide [State Machine Design](#state-machine-design) principles:

- `touchInterpreter`: `no_touch | single_touch | multi_touch`
- `mouseDragInterpreter`: `idle | dragging`
- `doubleTapInterpreter`: `idle | awaiting_second_tap`

For example, a `single_touch` state necessarily carries exactly one touch point, and a `multi_touch` state necessarily carries exactly two. `touchInterpreter` can transition `no_touch → single_touch` and `single_touch → multi_touch`, but not `no_touch → multi_touch` directly.

Each action corresponds to a DOM event. Side effects are confined to the thin `dispatch()` wrapper inside each interpreter factory, which calls `reduce`, updates the stored state, and emits the `InterpreterEvent` if one was returned.

## Model Module

The Model module contains the pure state transition logic for transformations, expressed as the Model interface. Following the library-wide [State Machine Design](#state-machine-design) principles, it defines a reducer that describes how the transform state changes in response to gestures and animation ticks. Separating this logic from the Store makes it independently testable and replaceable.

### Pre-Built Models

The Model module provides factory functions for several pre-built Models for common use cases such as single-item pinch-to-zoom and multi-item carousels.


```typescript
declare function createModel(options: { /* model-specific options */ }): Model<State, TransformPrivateState, StoreAction>;
```

#### Single-Item Transform Model

A Model for single-item pinch-to-zoom and pan. Supports optional snapping.

```typescript
type Options = {
  x?: (value: number) => number;
  y?: (value: number) => number;
};
```

#### Multi-Item Carousel Model

A Model for multi-item carousels that support per-item pinch-to-zoom.:

```typescript
type Options = {
  itemWidth: number;   // item container width (px)
  itemHeight: number;  // item container height (px)
  itemIds: readonly string[];  // ordered list of item identifiers
};
```

#### Transform and TransformVelocity

The model reducers represent motion state as two flat types:

- `Transform: { x: number; y: number; scale: number }` — current position and scale.
- `TransformVelocity: { vx: number; vy: number; logVScale: number }` — rates of change. `vx`/`vy` are linear (px/ms); `logVScale` is in log-space (log-units/ms) for natural pinch-zoom behavior.

`x`, `y`, and `scale` are treated as an atomic unit — operations that change scale also adjust translation via `applyScalePivot` to maintain the correct pivot point. A shared `lastUpdatedAt: number` (NaN when never updated) tracks when the state was last changed.

Velocity is internal state and is not included in the public `State`.


## Store Module

The Store module is a generic animation loop. It subscribes to Interpreter events, applies them to a reducer, and emits the resulting public state to subscribers on every animation frame.

The Store has a continuous update loop driven by `requestAnimationFrame()`. Motion events received from Interpreters are applied to the reducer. The tick action is dispatched on each frame to advance inertia or spring animations.

The Store's update loop emits state to subscribers on every frame where the state changes. The loop pauses automatically when the reducer returns the same object reference as the previous state (indicating the state has settled), and resumes when an Interpreter emits a new event. This pause/resume behavior is an implementation detail of the Store — other modules must not depend on it. The reference equality contract described in [State Machine Design](#state-machine-design) is what enables this optimization.

```typescript
type Store<TState> = (interpreters: MountedInterpreter[]) => MountedStore<TState>;
type MountedStore<TState> = {
  subscribe: (cb: Callback<TState>) => UnsubscribeFn;
  unmount: UnmountFn;
};

declare function createStore<TPrivateState, TState>(
  model: Model<TState, TPrivateState, StoreAction>,
): Store<TState>;
```

Mounting the `MountedInterpreter[]` passed to the Store (i.e., calling the Interpreters) is the responsibility of the caller.

To create a transform store with the default Model:

```typescript
const store = createStore(createModel(snapConfig));
```

## Renderer Module

The Renderer module receives transform information from the Store and applies it to the actual DOM element. This includes logic for scaling and translating the element using CSS transforms.

The Renderer subscribes to the Store and updates the target element's CSS transform whenever State changes. The Renderer holds no internal state and is responsible only for side effects (DOM updates).

```typescript
type Renderer = (element: Element, store: MountedStore) => MountedRenderer;
type MountedRenderer = {
  unmount: UnmountFn;
};

declare function createRenderer(): Renderer;
```

## Module Dependencies

- The Renderer depends on the Store. The Renderer subscribes to the Store's state and applies transformations to the target element.
- The Store depends on the Interpreter and the Model. The Store wires them together into an animation loop.
- The Model does not depend on the Store, Interpreter, or Renderer. It is a pure function from state and action to state.
- The Interpreter does not depend on the Store, Model, or Renderer. The Interpreter focuses solely on processing user input and generating Motion.

## Testing Policy

Each module should be tested individually through unit tests. The Interpreter module requires tests to verify that correct InterpreterEvents are emitted from user input, including both motion events and release events. The Model module requires tests to verify that the reducer produces correct state transitions for every combination of state and action. The Store module requires tests to verify the animation loop mechanics: that interpreter events are forwarded to the reducer, that subscribers receive the output of `toPublicState` on each frame, and that the loop stops after unmount. The Renderer module requires tests to verify that correct CSS transforms are applied based on the Store's state.
